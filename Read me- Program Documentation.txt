Description:

This project is an implementation of a compression based evaluation system for 
representations of music files. The system uses Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm to 
compress and decompress files. There are also functions for doing the evaluation.
Evaluation is based on the complexity of the representations and the complexity 
value is based on compression rate and effort to compress the input data.

Commands to use the system;

1) Put only 1 .abc file in the "abcFiles" directory.
2) Open the Jupyter Notebook using the command line.
3) Select the directory where "music_evaluation.ipynb" file is.
4) Open the "music_evaluation.ipynb" on Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells.
5) If there is a problem in definition of "dic" please re-run that cell.
6) After re-running the cell that defines the "dic" run the MAIN CELL again. 

*** To build a growing dictionary after the first successful run don't define the 
"dic" again by running that cell. Only run the MAIN CELL with the same input or a 
different input. Bare in mind that only 1 file at a time can be placed in the 
"abcFiles" directory.
